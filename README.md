Both IDB and jsPDF are open-source libraries:
This is an open-source library designed to simplify working with IndexedDB in JavaScript. It provides a more developer-friendly API for interacting with IndexedDB.
This is an open-source library for generating PDF documents in JavaScript.

I only use two js libraries for added functionally.
I didn't use any js frameworks. I just used vanilla javascript so anyone can add or adopt in to their own projects.
